/* Windows.h will #define MOUSE_MOVED to 0x1,  which is what the
Windows API expects.  In Curses,  MOUSE_MOVED is a macro indicating
whether the mouse has moved,  so we'd get a compiler warning that
we're re-defining MOUSE_MOVED.  That warning may be a Good Thing in
your software,  letting you know:  "Be careful;  in a Curses program,
MOUSE_MOVED won't have the same meaning it does in a 'real' Windows
program."

   But in building WinGUI itself,  we're expecting the Curses
meaning for MOUSE_MOVED,  and the compiler warning would just be
a nuisance.  So we'll #undefine MOUSE_MOVED before getting to the
Curses definition :                 */

/* WinGUI has some drastically extended cursor possibilities.  The
following #defines can be used with curs_set().  For all other flavors
of PDCurses,  only the invisible,  "normal",  and "intense" cursor
states will be recognized.  In Win32,  caret,  half-block,  central
block,  cross,  and outlined block cursors are available.

   By default,  all such cursors will blink.  However,  in WinGUI,
the input value to curs_set() is treated as a two-byte value,  with
the cursor blinking between those two states.  For example,
curs_set( 0x0102) would blink between a "normal" (underline) cursor and
an "intense" (full-block) cursor.  One can see that this behavior is
backward-compatible;  for example,  curs_set( 1) would blink between a
"normal" underline cursor and an invisible cursor.  (But curs_set( 0x0101)
would result in a non-blinking underline cursor.)  Note that one can use
the PDC_CURSOR macro for this,  as in...

   curs_set( PDC_CURSOR( PDC_CURSOR_OUTLINE, PDC_CURSOR_INTENSE));   */
