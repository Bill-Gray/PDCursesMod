Simple (dare I say trivial?) bitmapped screen fonts such as the ones
included in this collection cannot be copyrighted. In general, one can
only copyright programs that generate fonts. This is why postscript
fonts are copyrightable. For more details refer to discussions various
"legal" newsgroups. In addition, I have included a relevant excerpt
from the FAQ of comp.fonts at the bottom of this document.

No one can claim any copyright on the fonts in this archive. They
have been collected from numerous sources. Legally speaking, you are
*free* to do with the individual fonts whatever you like. Individual
fonts are in the public domain. I do ask that you will kindly refrain
from causing confusion by distributing modified versions of the fonts
contained in this collection.

Please send any all your EGA/VGA text mode fonts contributions to me
rather than distributing a modified version of this collection. I
will add your fonts to the next edition of this collection and happily
acknowledge your help. Your cooperation will enable us all to benefit
from your contribution. See the file LOOKING4.TXT for more details.

I am trying to keep track of the origins of these fonts. See the file
FONTORIG.TXT. Unfortunately, I only started to record this information
on version 1.2. Records of origin of earlier fonts are missing.
If you know the origin of any of the fonts here, please drop me a note.

Staring on version 1.6 the collection also includes some of the
miscellaneous utilities which I use for preparing it. Among these
you will find programs for loading, viewing, trimming and otherwise
manipulating the fonts. These utilities are also distributed as a
separate archive called fntutlXX.ZIP where XX is the version number.
All the utilities require no shareware payment. Restrictions on
distribution and usage are only to the extent necessary to protect
the free distribution.

Welcome to the comp.fonts FAQ.	This article, posted monthly, describes
many of the basic questions that seem to be repeated frequently on
comp.fonts.  Your comments are both welcome and encouraged.

   Standard disclaimers apply.

....
   At one level, there are two major sorts of fonts: bitmapped and
   outline (scalable).	Bitmapped fonts are falling out of fashion
   as various outline technologies grow in popularity and support.

   Bitmapped fonts represent each character as a rectangular grid of
   pixels.  The bitmap for each character indicates precisely what
   pixels should be on and off.  Printing a bitmapped character is
   simply a matter of blasting the right bits out to the printer.
   There are a number of disadvantages to this approach.  The bitmap
   represents a particular instance of the character at a particular
   size and resolution.  It is very difficult to change the size,
   shape, or resolution of a bitmapped character without significant
   loss of quality in the image.  On the other hand, it's easy to do
   things like shading and filling with bitmapped characters.

.....

5. Are fonts copyrightable?

   This topic is hotly debated at regular intervals on comp.fonts.
   Terry Carroll <tjc50@juts.ccc.amdahl.COM> provides the following
   analysis of current [ed: as of 6/92] legislation and regulation
   regarding fonts and copyrights.  Members of the comp.fonts community
   are encouraged to submit other materials that add clarity to the
   issue.

   First, the short answer: Typefaces are not copyrightable; bitmapped
   fonts are not copyrightable, but scalable fonts are copyrightable.
   Authorities for these conclusions follow.

   Before we get started, let's get some terminology down:

   A typeface is a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic
   characters, whose forms are related by repeating design elements
   consistently applied in a notational system and are intended to be
   embodied in articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use
   in composing text or other cognizable combinations of characters.

   A font is the computer file or program that is used to represent
   or create the typeface.

   Now, on to the legal authorities:

   Volume 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations specifies this about
   the copyrightability of typefaces:

   "The following are examples of works not subject to copyright and
   applications for registration of such works cannot be entertained:
   . . . typeface as typeface" 37 CFR 202.1(e).

   By the way, you won't find that in the most recent (7/1/91) edition
   of the CFR; the addition was enacted 2/21/92.  It'll be in the
   next edition, though.  It's described in the 2/21/92 edition of
   the Federal Register, page 6201 (57 FR 6201).  The change didn't
   actually change the law, it just clarified it, and codified existing
   Copyright Office policy.

   The regulation is in accordance with the House of Representatives
   report that accompanied the new copyright law, when it was passed
   in 1976:

   "The Committee has considered, but chosen to defer, the possibility
   of protecting the design of typefaces.  A 'typeface' can be defined
   as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose
   forms are related by repeating design elements consistently applied
   in a notational system and are intended to be embodied in articles
   whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing text
   or other cognizable combinations of characters.  The Committee
   does not regard the design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a
   copyrightable 'pictoral, graphic, or sculptural work' within the
   meaning of this bill and the application of the dividing line in
   section 101."  H. R. Rep.  No.  94-1476, 94th Congress, 2d Session
   at 55 (1976), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Cong. and Admin. News 5659,
   5668.

   It's also in accordance with the one court case I know of that
   has considered the matter: Eltra Corp. V. Ringer, 579 F.2d 294,
   208 USPQ 1 (1978, C.A. 4, Va.).

   The Copyright Office holds that a bitmapped font is nothing more
   than a computerized representation of a typeface, and as such is
   not copyrightable:

   "The [September 29, 1988] Policy Decision [published at 53 FR 38110]
   based on the [October 10,] 1986 Notice of Inquiry [published at 51
   FR 36410] reiterated a number of previous registration decisions
   made by the [Copyright] Office.  First, under existing law, typeface
   as such is not registerable.  The Policy Decision then went on
   to state the Office's position that 'data that merely represents
   an electronic depiction of a particular typeface or individual
   letterform' [that is, a bitmapped font] is also not registerable."
   57 FR 6201.

   However, scalable fonts are, in the opinion of the Copyright
   Office, computer programs, and as such are copyrightable:

   "... the Copyright Office is persuaded that creating scalable
   typefonts using already-digitized typeface represents a
   significant change in the industry since our previous [September
   29, 1988] Policy Decision.  We are also persuaded that computer
   programs designed for generating typeface in conjunction with low
   resolution and other printing devices may involve original computer
   instructions entitled protection under the Copyright Act.  For
   example, the creation of scalable font output programs to produce
   harmonious fonts consisting of hundreds of characters typically
   involves many decisions in drafting the instructions that drive the
   printer.  The expression of these decisions is neither limited by
   the unprotectable shape of the letters nor functionally mandated.
   This expression, assuming it meets the usual standard of authorship,
   is thus registerable as a computer program."  57 FR 6202.
