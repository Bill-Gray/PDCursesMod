Fonts for PDCurses for SDL
==========================

Since PDCurses for SDL uses its own font format, you probably don't have 
any ready to use. Here are a few to get you started. The ones in the 
top-level directory are as follows:

10x20.bmp	- From the 10x20 font that comes with Xorg
6x12.bmp	- From Xorg
9x18.bmp	- From Xorg
default.bmp	- PDCurses' default font, from pc8x16s.bdf in the
		  vgafonts.tar.gz package
lc12x20.bmp	- Lucida Console at 12x20
18x18.bmp	- From Xorg
8x13.bmp	- From Xorg
cour11x17.bmp	- From Xorg -- Courier
dosemu.bmp	- DOSEmu's default font (8x16)
medieval2.bmp	- I always liked the "medieval" font (see fntcol16); 
		  this is an enlarged (16x28), smoothed version
4x6.bmp		- From Xorg
9x15.bmp	- From Xorg
cour20x29.bmp	- From Xorg -- Courier
vga11x19.bmp	- From vgafonts, which says it's Lucida Sans Typewriter

In addition, the fntcol16 directory contains most of the fonts from the 
fntcol16.zip package. These are all 8 pixels wide, with the height given 
in the filename (e.g., modern-16.bmp).


Distribution Status
-------------------

I'll let copyleft.txt in the fntcol16 directory explain the situation, 
and just add that I don't claim any copyright on the compilation, 
either.
