#include <curses.h>

/* Test code for define_key().  At present,  this function
does nothing in PDCurses*.  It could be added to the VT platform,
if that proves desirable.  More generally,  though,  I'm thinking
that the ability to get KEY_FOCUS_IN and KEY_FOCUS_OUT via getch(),
on all platforms,  might be useful.  At present,  our programs
have no way of knowing if they've lost/regained focus.

   If we did such a thing,  the following bits would still be
needed for portable programs.  That is to say,  if you weren't
using PDCursesMod,  you would need to #define KEY_FOCUS_*,  make
the two calls to define_key(),  and emit the control sequence
so that those events would be sent to the program.   */
