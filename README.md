Welcome to PDCursesMod!
=======================

Public Domain Curses, aka PDCursesMod, is an implementation of X/Open
curses for multiple platforms. Relative to the ['official' PDCurses
project](https://www.github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses),  this has a variety of improvements,  adding Windows GUI,
VT-like console,  DOSVGA,  and Plan 9 "flavors" of Curses and expanding
the capabilities of the other flavors (SDL1,  SDL2,  X11, Win32 console,
OS/2, and DOS).  Some details and screen shots at

https://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm

Much of this was done during a long period in which the 'official'
PDCurses  was inactive.  Since then,  that version has again been
somewhat active;  most improvements made there have been taken into
this project,  and some improvements from here have gone into PDCurses.
Most programs that compile and run with PDCurses or ncurses will also
compile with PDCursesMod,  and vice versa, as long as you stick to the
(substantial) subset of common functionality. However,  the split
appears to be permanent.
