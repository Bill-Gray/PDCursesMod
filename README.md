Welcome to PDCurses!
====================

Public Domain Curses, aka PDCurses, is an implementation of X/Open
curses for multiple platforms. Relative to the 'official' PDCurses
project,  this has a variety of improvements,  adding a Windows GUI
and a VT-like console "flavor" of Curses and expanding the
capabilities of the other flavors (SDL1,  SDL2,  X11, Win32 console,
OS/2, and DOS).  Some details and screen shots at

https://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm

Much of this was done during a long period in which 'official'
PDCurses was inactive.  It is hoped that the changes in this fork
can be merged into the 'official' PDCurses,  and a pull request has
been made.  But the split is looking increasingly permanent.
